                <p>RSK is launching its bitcoins smart contracts platform in beta today.</p>

                <p class="mtb-15">Formerly known as Rootstock, the startup has long been lauded for Rs potential to pave the way for the
                    implementation of ethereum-style smart contracts on broom. something enthusiasts believe vein keep the wodd's
                    largest cryptocurrency competitive with the platform t hnl acquably pionverecl
                    the idea I hat mote executing code could be rim on a bickchain.</p>

                <p class="mtb-15">But while it would be easy enough for Wan users that want more complex smart contracts oo merely
                    some users believe that. as tdcoin is the largest and most secure cryptocumency, more experimental
                    features that debut on other networks will eventually make hal in

                <p class="mtb-15">Yet.RSK's version of the functionality doesn't quite upgrade the bmcom blockchain itself. I he
                    capability will rather be brought to brtcoin via a sidechain. which moves tokens from the main btroin
                    blockchaln to a compatible network operated with the help of 25 companies.</p>

                <p class="mtb-15">Still, RSK's CEO Diego Gutierrez 7aldivar believes the advance will effectively provide

                <p class="mtb-15">You are not able to purchase POWR with "Fiat" currency so you will need to first purchase another

                    debit / credit card purchase and then swap that for POWR at an exchange such as Binance.</p>

                <p class="mtb-15">You will have to carry out some identity verification when signing up as they have
                    to adhere to strict financial guidelines. Make sure you use our link to signup you will be
                    credited with $10 in free bitcoin when you make your first purchase of $100 </p>
